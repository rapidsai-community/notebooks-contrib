# RAPIDS Notebooks-Contrib
## Intro
Welcome to the contributed notebooks repo! (formerly known as Notebooks-Extended)

The purpose of this collection of notebooks is to help users understand what RAPIDS has to offer, learn why, how, and when including RAPIDS in a data science pipeline makes sense, and contain community contributions of RAPIDS knowledge. The difference between this repo and the [Notebooks Repo](https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks) are:
1. These are vetted, community-contributed notebooks (includes RAPIDS team member contributions).  
1. These notebooks won't run on airgapped systems, which is one of our container requirements.  Many RAPIDS notebooks use additional PyData ecosystem packages, and include code for downloading datasets, thus they require network connectivity. If running on a system with no network access, please download all the data that you plan to use ahead of time or simply use the [core notebooks repo](https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks).

## Installation

Please use the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) to check the pre-requisite packages and installation steps.

## Contributing

Please see our [guide for contributing to notebooks-contrib](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Exploring the Repo

- `getting_started_notebooks` - “how to start using RAPIDS”.  Contains notebooks showing "hello worlds", getting started with RAPIDS libraries, and tutorials around RAPIDS concepts.   
- `intermediate_notebooks` - “how to accomplish your workflows with RAPIDS”.  Contains notebooks showing algorthim and workflow examples, benchmarking tools, and some complete end-to-end (E2E) workflows.
- `advanced_notebooks` - "how to master RAPIDS".  Contains notebooks showing kernel customization and advanced end-to-end workflows.
- `colab_notebooks` - contains colab versions of popular notebooks to quickly try out in browser
- `blog notebooks` - contains shared notebooks mentioned and used in blogs that showcase RAPIDS workflows and capabilities
- `conference notebooks` - contains notebooks used in conferences, such as GTC
- `competition notebooks` - contains notebooks used in competitions, such as Kaggle

`/data` contains small data samples used for purely functional demonstrations. Some notebooks include cells that download larger datasets from external websites.

The `/data` folder is also symlinked into `/rapids/notebooks/extended/data` so you can browse it from JupyterLab's UI.

# Our Notebooks
Below is a listing of the notebooks in this repository.  Each row will tell you the notebook's 
- Location in **Folder**
- Notebook Title and Direct Link in **Notebook Title**
- Descrption in **Descirption**
- Design is for a `Single GPU`(SG) or `Mutliple GPUs`(MG) in **GPU** (don't worry, you can still run the multi-GPU notebooks with a single GPU)
- Data can be found in **Datasts Used**
