    "# PageRank\n",
    "#### Author : Alex Fender\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show how to use multi-GPU features in cuGraph to compute the PageRank of each user in Twitter's dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be aware that your system may be different, and you may need to modify the code or install packages to run the below examples. If you think you have found a bug or an error, please file an issue in [cuGraph](https://github.com/rapidsai/cugraph/issues)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was run on 2x NVIDIA Tesla 32GB V100 GPUs (connected with nvlink) using RAPIDS 0.9.0 and CUDA 10.0. It also works on 2x NVIDIA 32GB GV100 GPUs using RAPIDS 0.10.0 and CUDA 10.0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Pagerank is measure of the relative importance of a vertex based on the relative importance of its neighbors.  PageRank was invented by Google Inc. and is (was) used to rank its search results. PageRank uses the connectivity information of a graph to rank the importance of each vertex. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) for more details on the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "CuGraph's multi-GPU features leverage Dask. RAPIDS has other projects based on Dask such as dask-cudf and dask-cuda. These products will also be used in this example. Check out [RAPIDS.ai](https://rapids.ai/) to learn more about these technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the Pagerank with cuGraph we use:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cugraph.dask.pagerank.pagerank(edge_list, alpha=0.85, max_iter=30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "*  *edge_list* : `dask_cudf.DataFrame`<br>\n",
    "Contain the connectivity information as an edge list. Source 'src' and destination 'dst' columns must be of type 'int32'. Edge weights are not used for this algorithm. Indices must be in the range [0, V-1], where V is the global number of vertices. The input edge list should be provided in dask-cudf DataFrame with one partition per GPU.\n",
    "*  *alpha* : `float`<br>\n",
    "The damping factor alpha represents the probability to follow an outgoing edge, standard value is 0.85. Thus, 1.0-alpha is the probability to “teleport” to a random vertex. Alpha should be greater than 0.0 and strictly lower than 1.0.\n",
    "* *max_iter* : `int`<br>\n",
    "The maximum number of iterations before an answer is returned. If this value is lower or equal to 0 cuGraph will use the default value, which is 30. In this notebook, we will use 20 to compare against published results.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns\n",
    "\n",
    "* *PageRank* : `dask_cudf.DataFrame`<br>\n",
    "Dask GPU DataFrame containing two columns of size V: the vertex identifiers and the corresponding PageRank values."
