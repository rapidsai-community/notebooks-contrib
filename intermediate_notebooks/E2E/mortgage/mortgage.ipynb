This processed dataset is redistributed with permission and consent from Fannie Mae.\n",

    "To acquire this dataset, please visit [RAPIDS Datasets Homepage](https://docs.rapids.ai/datasets/mortgage-data).  We've also added some cells below to make it easier to download the data, set parameters, and run the notebook.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Mortgage workflow is composed of three core phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ETL - Extract, Transform, Load\n",
    "2. Data Conversion\n",
    "3. ML - Training\n",
    "\n",
    "### ETL\n",
    "Data is \n",
    "1. Read in from storage\n",
    "2. Transformed to emphasize key features\n",
    "3. Loaded into volatile memory for conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Conversion\n",
    "Features are\n",
    "1. Broken into (labels, data) pairs\n",
    "2. Distributed across many workers\n",
    "3. Converted into compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix format for XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "The CSR data is fed into a distributed training session with Dask-XGBoost"

RMM requires you to declare the number of workers RMM defaults to 50% of your GPU memory size.  However, you are able to manage the memory to use up to 100% and that may help your performance, and maybe some out of memory errors.  Below are some 90%+ values that you can use to set your `initial_pool_size`.  They are commented out, as is setting the inital pool size.  Uncomment the one you want to use."
