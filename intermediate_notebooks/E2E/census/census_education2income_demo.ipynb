    "# Census Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Held every 10 years, the US census gives a detailed snapshot in time about the makeup of the country.  The last census in 2010 surveyed nearly 309 million people.  IPUMS.org provides researchers an open source data set with 1% to 10% of the census data set.  In this notebook, we want to see how education affects total income earned in the US based on data from each census from the 1970 to 2010 and see if we can predict some results if the census was held today, according to the national average.  We will go through the ETL, training the model, and then testing the prediction.  We'll make every effort to get as balanced of a dataset as we can.  We'll also pull some extra variables to allow for further self-exploration of gender based education and income breakdowns.  On a single Titan RTX, you can run the whole notebook workflow on the 4GB dataset of 14 million rows by 44 columns in less than 3 minutes.  "
