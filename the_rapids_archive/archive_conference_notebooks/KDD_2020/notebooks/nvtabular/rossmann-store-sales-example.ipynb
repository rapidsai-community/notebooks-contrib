Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.</blockquote>"

We'll build a quick implementation of the metric Kaggle used in the original competition so that we can keep tabs on it during training.\n",

    "This does fairly well straight away, with minimal tuning of hyperparemeters and thought given to specific features and feature engineering. We also could reconsider the network structure, opting for something other than a simple MPE. In reality, it would take a RMSPE <= 0.10021 to beat the eventual winner of this specific Kaggle compeition. So while this submission won't win that Kaggle competition, the hope was to illustrate how easy it is to process data using NVTabular and feed it to a neural network in TensorFlow."
