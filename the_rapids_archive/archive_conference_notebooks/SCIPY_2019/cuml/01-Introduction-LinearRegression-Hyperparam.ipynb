    "Scikit-Learn is an incredibly powerful toolkit that allows data scientists to quickly build models from their data, and it one of the most common and useful tools in the Python data science ecosystem. cuML is the RAPIDS library that implements similar machine learning algorithms that use CUDA to run on GPUs, with an API that mirrors the Scikit-learn one as much as possible. \n",
